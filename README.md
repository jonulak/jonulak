# About me
I'm an aspiring developer with health care and military experience. My current focus is building design and development skills through personal projects. I'm searching for entry level positions where I will have an opportunity to collaborate with and learn from more experienced developers, further develop an understanding of app architecture and design, and have the opportunity to develop new and useful app features.
